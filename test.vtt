00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.580
- [Instructor] In this
video, we're going to dig

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.840
a little bit deeper and try to understand

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.230
how we might multiply
larger and larger numbers.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.360
In particular, we're gonna focus on

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.740
multiplying two-digit numbers
times one-digit numbers.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.560
So, I always encourage
you pause this video,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.220
and see if you can have a go at this.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.690
Try to see if you can figure
out what 37 times six is

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.053
with some type of method.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.010
All right, now let's try to
come up with a method ourselves.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.290
One way to think about it
is the different places.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.780
This three is in the tens place,

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.400
so it represents three
tens, and this seven is

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.640
in the ones place, so it
represents seven ones.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.640
So, you can break up the 37
right over here as three tens.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.160
I'll write it like this.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.700
Three tens plus,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.460
plus, and I'll do this
in yellow, seven ones.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.460
And then, we are going to
multiply that times six.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.020
Now, another way you
could think about this,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.470
this is the same thing as,
I could rewrite this as,

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.360
three tens is the same thing
as 30, and seven ones is,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.890
of course, just the same
thing as seven times six.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.100
And, you could also view
this, and you could call

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.660
the distributive property if you like,

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.170
or I really want you to think
about it, why it's intuitive.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.600
If I have 37 sixes, that's
the same thing as 30 sixes,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.600
30 sixes plus seven sixes,

00:01:19.935 --> 00:01:24.860
plus seven sixes, and I'll
put the parentheses there

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.390
just so we can keep track.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.770
Once again, 37 of something is equal to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.930
30 of that something plus
seven of that something.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.580
37 times six is 30 times
six plus seven times six.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.580
Then, we could figure these out.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.140
What is 30 times six?

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.190
Well, three times six is
18, so three tens times six

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.270
is going to be 18 tens which
is the same thing as 180,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.704
and seven times six is 42.

00:01:50.704 --> 00:01:53.350
We just then need to
add these two numbers,

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.480
and we could think about them

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.950
in terms of the different places.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.140
We could look at the ones
place, zero ones, two ones,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.390
so that'll give us two ones.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.900
Then, we can think in
terms of the tens place,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.590
so we have four tens and eight tens,

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.690
so that is going to be 12 tens.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.260
We could write that down as 120.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.510
Then, we only have 100 right over here,

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.360
so we don't have a
hundreds place over here,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.250
so I'll do 100, and if
you add these together,

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.320
100 plus 120, you add the
hundreds, you get 220.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.440
Then, you add the two ones.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.360
You get 222.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.820
So, this is all going to be equal to 222.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.940
Now, this isn't the
only way to approach it.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.610
We could actually try to
do it kind of like this,

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.980
but we could write things so it's

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.040
a little bit easier to keep track of.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.040
So, I could write, let me write
it this way, 37 times six.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.210
I'll have you, this column
here is where I want

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.700
to write my ones places,
and this column here is

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.030
where I wanna write my tens places,

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.430
and if hundreds places show
up, I'll write it over there.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.983
That's just really to
keep track of things.

00:02:55.983 --> 00:02:57.810
Then, I can do the same thing.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.050
I could take my six, and
I could say all right,

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.990
this is the same thing
as three tens times six

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.950
plus seven ones times six.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.330
And, I could do it in either order.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.820
Let's do the ones first.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.950
So if I do the seven ones times
six, that's going to be 42,

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.330
four tens plus two ones.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.230
How did I get that?

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.060
That is seven ones times
six or seven sixes.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.180
That's how I got this number here.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.730
Then, we could multiply our
three tens times the six

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.730
which we did over here,
so three tens times six.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.480
Well, that's 30 sixes which
we already know is 180.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.660
One in the hundreds place,
eight tens, zero ones.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.490
Now, this makes it a little bit easier

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.850
to add everything together.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.080
Exactly what we did at
this step right over here.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.140
Everything is in the right place value,

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.120
so it's easy to add them up.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.120
Two ones plus zero ones
is going to be two ones.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.820
Four tens plus eight tens is 12 tens

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.540
or 102 tens, so I could
put the two tens here

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.540
and then put that 100 up here,
and then 100 plus 100 is 200.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.290
So, there you have it, 222.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.050
The whole point here though is

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.420
to really appreciate what is going on.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.560
That we're just breaking up the 37.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.820
We're breaking up this two-digit
number into its places,

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.220
the three tens, the seven ones,
and then we're multiplying

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.090
each of those times the
six in this situation,

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.510
and we did it both ways.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.100
These are just different
ways to write the same,

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.353
really the same method.
