1
00:00:00,341 --> 00:00:02,861
Voiceover:Gavin has these horses.

2
00:00:02,861 --> 00:00:06,945
Is the number of horses in each picture below

3
00:00:06,945 --> 00:00:11,410
more than, less than, or same as

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,641
the number of horses Gavin has?

5
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:19,137
Let's first look at how many horses Gavin has.

6
00:00:19,137 --> 00:00:25,960
He has one, two, three, four, five, six horses.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,300
Let's remember that

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,090
and let's compare each of these amounts of horses

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,240
to the six horses that Gavin has.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,641
Let's look over here,

11
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:39,296
over here we have one, two, three,

12
00:00:39,296 --> 00:00:41,861
four, five, six horses.

13
00:00:41,861 --> 00:00:44,866
This is the same number that Gavin has,

14
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:46,792
they're just arranged differently.

15
00:00:46,792 --> 00:00:49,176
This is the same,

16
00:00:49,176 --> 00:00:52,884
we'll put in the Same as bucket.

17
00:00:52,884 --> 00:00:57,681
Now, here we have one, two, three, four five horses.

18
00:00:57,681 --> 00:01:02,054
This is less than the six horses that Gavin has,

19
00:01:02,054 --> 00:01:04,016
five is less than six.

20
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:06,301
Here and I can just look at this

21
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:08,046
and see that there's more than six

22
00:01:08,046 --> 00:01:09,279
but we can count them.

23
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:11,618
We have one, two, three, four, five,

24
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:13,986
and then another five that's going to be 10.

25
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:16,089
Or we can say one, two, three, four, five,

26
00:01:16,089 --> 00:01:18,746
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

27
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,910
Well 10 is more than six,

28
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:23,183
10 is more than six,

29
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,621
so we'll put it in the More than bucket.

30
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:29,085
Now here we have four and four

31
00:01:29,085 --> 00:01:30,713
well that's going to be eight.

32
00:01:30,713 --> 00:01:32,235
One, two, three, four,

33
00:01:32,235 --> 00:01:33,764
five, six, seven, eight.

34
00:01:33,764 --> 00:01:38,290
It's again, that is more than the six up here.

35
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:40,588
That's more than six

36
00:01:40,588 --> 00:01:42,371
and then here we have one, two,

37
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:43,775
three, four horses.

38
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:46,818
Well four is less than six,

39
00:01:46,818 --> 00:01:48,760
so I will put that,

40
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,485
I will put that in the less than,

41
00:01:52,485 --> 00:01:55,948
in the Less than bucket just like that.

42
00:01:55,948 --> 00:01:58,792
Let's check our answer to see how we did.

43
00:02:00,115 --> 00:02:01,379
We got it right.
